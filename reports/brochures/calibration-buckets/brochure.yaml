name: "Calibration - All Buckets"
description: |
  Benchmarks all pressure level buckets to learn optimal configurations.
  Tests EXTREME, MEGA, and HTTP_30S levels which are relevant for production.
  Each bucket runs for 30 seconds to allow the system to converge.

component: calibration
duration: 30000  # 30 seconds per bucket
concurrency: 100

config:
  # Buckets to benchmark (subset of all levels for faster runs)
  buckets:
    - EXTREME     # 10K-100K req/s - Peak load
    - MEGA        # 1M-10M req/s - Benchmark
    - HTTP_30S    # 10M-100M req/s - Max throughput

  # Learning parameters
  learningRounds: 5           # Exploration rounds per bucket
  explorationRate: 0.15       # 15% random exploration
  targetLatencyWeight: 0.3    # Latency penalty weight in scoring

  # Regression detection

# Expected baseline results (for regression detection)
