# Expected throughput from documented benchmarks (HTTP_SERVER_BENCHMARKS.md)
# Sequential mode: 52,486 req/s (realistic for production)
# Pipelined mode: 3,733,623 req/s (NOT realistic - see note below)
expectedThroughput: 52486
expectedThroughputNote: "Sequential mode (no pipelining)"

# IMPORTANT: HTTP pipelining (3.7M req/s) is NOT realistic for production.
# In real-world scenarios, different users (citizens) make individual HTTP requests.
# Pipelining batches multiple requests from the SAME client over a single connection,
# which doesn't happen with diverse user traffic. Use microbatching instead.
